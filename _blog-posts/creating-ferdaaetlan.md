title: How I Created a Bus Route Planner
description: >-
  I developed Ferðaætlan while studying in Tekniski Skúlanum í Klaksvík. It
  allows the user to see which SSL bus routes they need to take, to get to their
  destination. The website is developed using React and Firebase.

While brainstorming for local problems to solve for a class project, one of the problems we found was that it can be quite difficult to plan a trip in Faroe Islands using SSL's (The nationally owned transport company) website; especially if you'll need to take multiple busses/ferries.

Ultimately we decided not to develop a solution to this problem and rather pursued another super interesting problem. However, the transport problem didn't want to leave my mind, and so I decided to develop a website that might solve the problem.
